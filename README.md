## 1—INTRODUCTION TO RANDOM FORESTS
https://course18.fast.ai/lessonsml1/lesson1.html


Welcome to Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders! 

Lesson 1 will show you how to create a “random forest” - perhaps the most widely applicable machine learning model - to create a solution to the “Bull Book for Bulldozers” Kaggle competition, which will get you in to the top 25% on the leaderboard. 

You’ll learn how to use a Jupyter Notebook to build and analyze models, how to download data, and other basic skills you need to get started with machine learning in practice.

## Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Full Course from fast.ai and Jeremy Howard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oyCUWLL_fU&t=34041s

Practical Deep Learning for Coders is a course from fast.ai designed to give you a complete introduction to deep learning. This course was created to make deep learning accessible to as many people as possible. The only prerequisite for this course is that you know how to code (a year of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed a high school math course.

This course was developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. Jeremy has been using and teaching machine learning for around 30 years. He is the former president of Kaggle, the world's largest machine learning community. Sylvain Gugger is a researcher who has written 10 math textbooks.

### Book chapters and code on Google Colab

NB: Chapter 2 contains widgets, which unfortunately are not supported by Colab. Also, in some places we use a file upload button, which is also not supported by Colab. For those sections, either skip them, or use a different platform such as Gradient (Colab is the only platform which doesn't support widgets).
